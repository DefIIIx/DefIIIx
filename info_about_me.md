Hello everyone, I'm Defix, and the first thing I **have** to say it's that... I'm not a programmer.
I'm very bad at coding, I literally don't know anything excluding print("hello:3"). I just made a GitHub account, so if I would need some ₵ØĐɆ, I won't need to make an account (and a profile too).

A little bit of info about me:
Name: Michael *(You can call me Mike if you're too lazy to write)*
Pronouns: He/him *(I don't mind much about pronouns, so you can use They/them too.)*
Favorite color: Magenta-Pink-Purple *(All of those 'dreamy' colors.)*
Hobby(ies): Music, Vł฿Ɇ₵ØĐł₦₲, Cleaning *(and procastination.)*
